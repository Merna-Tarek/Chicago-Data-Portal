# Chicago-Data-Portal
I will be working on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal. 

Imagine, you have been hired by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. 

My job is to analyze the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district.

I will identify causes that impact the enrollment, safety, health, environment ratings of schools.
